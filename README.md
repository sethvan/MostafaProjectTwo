# MostafaProjectTwo
Console App challenge from Udemy Course done as Qt5 GUI, my first GUI, initial final version from 5/13/21.

Udemy Course is "Mastering 4 critical SKILLS using C++ 17" by Dr. Mostafa Saad Ibrahim. I purchased the 
course but have only consulted a few parts and done two project challenges of which this is the second. 

I did not notice until afterwards that it is not a true CRUD as it does not have any delete functions.
My main purpose in doing this project was to better learn and/or familiarize myself with OOP, QtCreator,
creating GUI's and CPP. Current version took me 6 days to complete. Adding delete functions and other 
improvements could still be made to this project.
